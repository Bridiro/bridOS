# bridOS

This is my first try building a 64bit os. I'm actually stuck in 32bit but the goal is to reach 64bit.
I'm following some tutorials and a lot of documentation.

# FINALLYYYY!!!

It gives me no more errors, now I just have to add some more commands and a small filesystem and it's done. 
If someone still want to help me you can just contact me, any help is precious to me.
