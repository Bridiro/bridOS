# bridOS

This is my first try building a 32bit os. I want it to be as simple as possible, but functional (it isn't and won't be).
I'm following some tutorials and a lot of documentation.

## What am I working on?

- First of all I'm trying to make [my font library](https://github.com/Bridiro/sw-lib-font) work with the OS (probably not enough memory loaded)
- I want to reach the same point as the CLI one before moving on
- I want to add a mouse support
- It would be a good idea to implement a basic filesystem (fron scratch is the idea, copied is the way)
- It would be great to reach a point where I can connect to internet (I know years will pass)

## So, how to you use it?

- Clone the repository
- Run `make` to compile it
- Run `make run` to run it
