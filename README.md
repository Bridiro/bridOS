This is my first try building a 64bit os. I'm actually stuck in 32bit but the goal is to reach 64bit.
I'm following some tutorials and a lot of documentation.

The main problem I'm having is in the Kernel. As you can see I created a Drivers forlder witch contains my driver. Now I have the driver to read and set data into the ports, and the one who gives problem, so the video driver. My print function don't work. 

But if I do the same thing in the main it works. Strings are giving me a lot of problems. So if you have time to watch the code and you find some errors please tell me in a comment or email me.
